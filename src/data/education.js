        term: "HRC (Rockwell Hardness)",
        def: "A scale used to measure the hardness of a material. Most knife steels range from 54 to 65 HRC. Higher hardness generally yields better edge retention but may decrease toughness."
    },
    {
        term: "Toughness",
        def: "The ability of a steel to resist chipping or breaking under impact or stress. Often a trade-off with edge retention."
    },

        term: "Edge Retention",
        def: "The ability of a knife blade to hold its sharpness during use. Influenced by hardness and carbide volume/type."
    },
    {
        term: "Corrosion Resistance",
        def: "The ability of a steel to resist rust and oxidation, primarily achieved through the addition of Chromium (typically >12% for stainless)."

    {
        term: "Carbides",
        def: "Hard particles formed when carbon bonds with alloying elements (Vanadium, Tungsten, Chromium). They provide wear resistance but can affect toughness."
    },

        term: "Powder Metallurgy (PM)",
        def: "A manufacturing process that creates a very fine, uniform distribution of carbides, leading to superior toughness and wear resistance compared to conventional ingot steels."

        term: "Austenite/Martensite",
        def: "Different crystalline structures of steel achieved through heat treatment. Martensite is the hard, desirable structure for knife blades."

        term: "Vanadium",
        def: "An alloying element that forms extremely hard 'Vanadium Carbides', which are primary drivers of wear resistance (edge retention)."
    },
    {
        term: "Cryogenic Treatment",
        def: "A process where steel is cooled to sub-zero temperatures (-185°C) during heat treatment to complete the transformation of austenite to martensite, improving hardness and stability."
    },
    {
        term: "Heat Treatment (HT)",
        def: "A controlled process of heating and cooling steel to change its molecular structure, bringing out its best performance properties."

        term: "Tempering",
        def: "A secondary heating process after hardening to reduce brittleness and increase toughness by making the steel less 'stressed'."

export const FAQ = [
    {
        q: "What is the best knife steel?",
        a: "There is no single 'best' steel. The right choice depends on your needs. For daily carry, M390 offers an elite balance. For pure toughness, CPM 3V is legendary. For ultimate edge retention, CPM S125V or Maxamet."
    },
    {
        q: "Why does my stainless steel knife have rust spots?",
        a: "No steel is truly 'rust-proof' (except maybe LC200N or Vanax). Even stainless steels can corrode if exposed to salt, acids, or moisture for long periods. Proper cleaning and drying are essential."
    },
    {
        q: "What is the difference between Powder Steel (PM) and conventional steel?",
        a: "PM (Powder Metallurgy) steels have a finer, more consistent grain structure than conventionally melted steels, allowing for higher alloy content without sacrificing as much toughness."
    },
    {
        q: "How often should I sharpen my knife?",
        a: "It depends on the steel and usage. Steels with high edge retention (like S90V) stay sharp longer but are harder to sharpen. Frequent stropping can maintain an edge and delay the need for a full sharpening session."
    },
    {
        q: "Is a harder knife always better?",
        a: "Not necessarily. While higher HRC (62+) means the edge stays sharp longer, it also makes the blade more 'brittle', meaning it might chip if you drop it or hit a bone. Balanced steels are often preferred for general use."
    },
    {
        q: "What is MagnaCut and why is everyone talking about it?",
        a: "MagnaCut is a revolutionary 'super steel' designed specifically for knives. It offers high toughness, high edge retention, AND incredible corrosion resistance—a trio of properties previously thought impossible to achieve at such high levels simultaneously."
